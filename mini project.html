            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Drip Irrigation is a type of micro irrigation system that has the potential to save water and 
                nutrients<br>by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of the plants, either from above the soil surface or 
                buried<br>below the surface. The goal is to place water directly in to the root zone and minimize evaporation. 
                <br>Drip irrigation systems distribute water through a network of valves, pipes, tubing and emitters.<br> Depending 
                on how well designed , installed ,maintained and operated it is , a drip irrigation system<br>can be more 
                efficient than other types of irrigation systems such as surface irrigation or sprinkler irrigation.
