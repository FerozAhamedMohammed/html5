            <p>
                This project is concerned with the ultimate axial compression load capacity of non-perforated 
and perforated equal-angle hot rolled steel columns.<br>Finite element analysis has been undertaken to 
investigate the behavior of such members and column specimens were tested to failure under<br>axial loading. 
The software used for finite element analysis in this project is <b>ABAQUS</b>.
